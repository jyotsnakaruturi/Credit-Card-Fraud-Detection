 
Credit Card Fraud Detection

📌 Project Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning**. It applies **classification algorithms** to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on various transaction features.

🚀 Features
- Data Preprocessing:Handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection.
- Fraud Classification:Using ML models to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Model Evaluation:Analyzing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization:Plotting fraud trends and feature distributions.

🔧 Technologies Used
- Programming Language:Python
- Libraries:Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow (if deep learning is used)
- Jupyter Notebook:For development and experimentation
